## Dev Note

This is a modified version of [Express
Generator](https://github.com/express/generator) which is nowadays highly
outdated.

There are already several forks of it out there.

The aim (or one of its) of this new fork is to catch the attention of the other
forks authors in order to join our efforts in a single package.

> ðŸ“Œ **If you are the author of one of these forks (or plan to create a new one),
> PLEASE contact me and I'll give you access to this repository.**
> 
> I'm not an experienced maintainer neither have a lot of time to invest in it.
> But hopefully we could keep this useful tool more updated.

### Name change

To break the "express-generatorX" sequence, I renamed it 'expressgen' which, in
turn, will be more handy to be used as 'npx expressgen'.

### Goals

You can find my inital goals in the [TO-DO List](./TODO.md) I added to the project.

Please feel free to suggest/add your own ones.


## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -g express-generator
```

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable `express(1)` to generate an application as shown below:

Create the app:

```bash
$ express --view=hbs /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start your Express.js app at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This generator can also be further configured with the following command line flags.
